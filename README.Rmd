`parzer` parses messy geographic coordinates

Docs: https://docs.ropensci.org/parzer/

You may get data from a published study or a colleague, and the coordinates
may be in some messy character format that you'd like to clean up to have 
all decimal degree numeric data.

`parzer` API:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, results='asis'}
cat(paste(" -", paste(sprintf("`%s`", sort(getNamespaceExports("parzer"))), collapse = "\n - ")))
```

## Usage
For example, parse latitude and longitude from messy character vectors. 

```{r}
parse_lat(c("45N54.2356", "-45.98739874", "40.123°")
```

```r
parse_lon(c("45W54.2356", "-45.98739874", "40.123°"))
```

See more in the [Introduction to the `parzer` package vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/parzer/articles/parzer.html). 

## Installation

Stable version

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("parzer")
```

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/parzer")
```

```{r}
library("parzer")
```


## Similar art

- `sp::char2dms`: is most similar to `parzer::parse_lat` and `parzer::parse_lon`. However,
with `sp::char2dms` you have to specify the termination character for each of degree,
minutes and seconds. `parzer` does this for the user.
- `biogeo::dms2dd`: very unlike functions in this package. You must pass separate degrees,
minutes, seconds and direction to `dms2dd`. No exact analog is found in `parzer`, whos
main focus is parsing messy geographic coordinates in strings to a more machine readable
version
